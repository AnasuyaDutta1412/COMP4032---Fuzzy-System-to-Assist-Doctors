Fuzzy CourseWork
=============

For Dataset - First run [dataset.py](dataset.py) to get 1000 data instance in file [emergency_data](emergency_dataset.csv)

Then run the file [dataset_mamdani.py](dataset_mamdani.py) to get defuzzified outputs for every instance in the same [emergency_data](emergency_dataset.csv)


```
This file consists the steps to run the code for both cases Case 1 and Case 2 defined in the question
```

Case 1 - All Numeric Inputs
Files to run for this case -> [model_inference_type1_mamdani.py](./models/model-inference_type1_mamdani.py) and [model_inference_type1_sugeno.py](./models/model-inference_type1_sugeno.py)

Case 2 - All Interval Based Inputs
Files to run for this case -> [model_inference_type1_mamdani_interval.py](./models/model_inference_type1_mamdani_interval.py) and [model_inference_type1_sugeno_interval.py](./models/model-inference_type1_sugeno_interval.py)

In order to run files for case 1
-------------------------------
Step 1 -> Give numeric inputs in the command line
```
For example:
Enter a Float Range of body_temp 35
Enter a Int Range of headache 9
Enter a Int Range of age 67
```

Step 2 -> A plotted graph showing all antecedents and consequents

![Image](./images/image.png)

In order to proceed terminate this window by pressing 

![terminate](./images/image-1.png)

After terminating wait for a few seconds and the rules screen will pop up

Step 3 -> Another graph showing all antecedents and consequents with inputs will show up

![Alt text](./images/image-2.png)

In order to proceed terminate this window by pressing 

![terminate](./images/image-1.png)

Step 4 -> You will be shown all the rules in both models along with the output aggregation in Mamdani model.

![Rules](./images/rules.png)

In order to proceed terminate this window by pressing 

![terminate](./images/image-1.png)

After that you will be returned to command line ->

Step 5 -> Here you can see the outputs ->

[For-Mamdani](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/types-of-fuzzy-inference-systems.html) ->
```
Centroid Defuzzification 76.9847651503233
Mean of Maxima: 80.5
First of Maxima: 61
Last of Maxima: 100
Middle of Maxima 80.5
```

[For-Sugeno](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/fuzzy/types-of-fuzzy-inference-systems.html) ->
```
Crisp Output 79.14176727950861
```
Done with Case 1

In order to run files for case 2
--------------------------------
Step 1 -> Give interval valued inputs in the command (line upper and lower bound)
```
For example: Inputs seperated with a space.
Enter a Float Range of body_temp 30 35
Enter a Int Range of headache 7 9
Enter a Int Range of age 50 67
```
Step 2, 3 and 4 and 5 are same as Case 1

Step 3 image
